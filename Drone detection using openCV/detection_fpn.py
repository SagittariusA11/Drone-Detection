"""
Explanation:

In this code, the pre-trained FPN model is loaded using the load_model function from the Keras library. 
The model is then used to detect drones in each frame of a video stream captured using the cv2.VideoCapture class from the OpenCV library. 
The model outputs are postprocessed to extract bounding boxes around the detected drones, and these boxes are then drawn on the original frame using the cv2.rectangle function from OpenCV. 
The resulting frames are displayed using the cv2.imshow function, and the loop is broken if the user presses the 'q' key.

Advantages of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN):

Improved accuracy: FPNs improve object detection accuracy by incorporating multi-scale feature information, which enhances the ability of the model to detect objects of different sizes.

Better handling of small objects: The feature pyramid structure of FPNs allows for better detection of small objects, which is a common problem in object detection.

Speed: FPNs are relatively fast compared to other object detection algorithms, making them suitable for real-time applications.

Robustness to scale variations: The multi-scale feature representation in FPNs makes the model robust to scale variations in the input image, which is useful in real-world applications where objects can be seen at different distances and scales.

Drawbacks of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN):

Complexity: FPNs are more complex compared to other object detection algorithms, which can make them difficult to train and deploy.

Memory requirements: FPNs require a large amount of memory, making them unsuitable for deployment on devices with limited memory.

Training time: FPNs can take longer to train compared to other object detection algorithms, which can be a disadvantage in applications where fast deployment is critical.

Need for additional components: FPNs require additional components such as region proposal networks (RPNs) to perform object detection, which can increase the complexity of the overall system.
